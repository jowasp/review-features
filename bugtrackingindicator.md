#Bug Tracking system

A bug tracking system or defect tracking system is a software application that keeps track of reported software bugs in software development projects. It may be regarded as a type of issue tracking system.

Many bug tracking systems, such as those used by most open source software projects, allow end-users to enter bug reports directly. [1] Other systems are used only internally in a company or organization doing software development. Typically bug tracking systems are integrated with other software project management applications.

A bug tracking system is usually a necessary component of a good software development infrastructure, and consistent use of a bug or issue tracking system is considered one of the "hallmarks of a good software team".[2]

The reviewer should confirm:
* The presence of a bug tracking system
* Amount of bugs in the tracking system (open+ close). The #of bugs is a clear indicator of community and user adoption. For more on this please check:

"Bug Growth is Proportional to User Growth, and Bugs are not Technical Debt[...] The number of bug reports is proportional to the number of users, not to the number of defects."
