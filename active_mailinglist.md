#User feedback

An Active Mailing for example is an indicator of user/community adoption and interest in the subject or matter treated by the project.
The project should provide a way to gather user feedback , open and accessible to everyone.
This can be in the form of:
* Mailing list
* Google groups
* Issue portal
* Open google documents with comment/suggestion option available
* Github comments

The reviewer should look at the amount of feedback/comments/emails/ generated in such list since the inception of the project.

It can be quite subjective to determine activity, however, if a project that exists for 1 year has no activity or a similar way to gather feedback from users, it has a clear indication it does not fill this criteria

In case , for example that a project that exists for a period of 1 year has less than 10 user comments/feedback(less than 1 comment in a month), it could indicate a low activity but clear interest from users

Reviewer should also analyze the situation of the project. For example, a stable project can have low comments during a period of time and very high during the promotion or development of new sections of features.
