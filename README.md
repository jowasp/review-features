# OWASP Review requirements per Category
The following table provides an overview of the required features that determine when an Code/Tool OWASP project belongs to a certain graduation criteria. 

The 'X' simbolize  a required requirement for that category.'-' Symbolizes that requirement is not needed for that category

##The OWASP Project Lifecycle:

is broken down into the following stages
###Project Idea:

During this phase, a potential project leader promotes his project idea without a define roadmap or plan. No requirements are needed during this phase

###Incubator Projects: 

OWASP Incubator projects represent the experimental playground where projects are still being designed, ideas are still being proven, and development is still underway. The “OWASP Incubator” label allows OWASP consumers to readily identify a project’s maturity; moreover, the label allows project leaders to leverage the OWASP name while their project is still maturing. OWASP Incubator projects are given a place on the OWASP Projects Portal to leverage the organizations' infrastructure, and establish their presence and project history.

###Lab Projects: 

OWASP Labs projects represent projects that have produced a deliverable of significant value. Leaders of OWASP Labs projects are expected to stand behind the quality of their projects as these projects have matured to the point where they are accepted by a significant portion of the OWASP community. While these projects are typically not production ready, the OWASP community expects that an OWASP Labs project leader is producing releases that are ready for mainstream usage. OWASP Labs Projects are meant to be the collection of established projects that have gained community support and acclaim by undergoing the project review process.

###Flagship Projects: 

The OWASP Flagship designation is given to projects that have demonstrated superior maturity, established quality, and strategic value to OWASP and application security as a whole. Eligible projects are selected from the OWASP Labs project pool. This selection process generally ensures that there is only one project of each type covering any particular security space. OWASP Flagship projects represent projects that are not only mature, but are also projects that OWASP as an organization provides direct support to maintaining. The core mission of OWASP is to make application security visible and so as an organization, OWASP has a vested interest in the success of its Flagship projects. Since Flagship projects have such high visibility, these projects are expected to uphold the most stringent requirements of all OWASP Projects.
