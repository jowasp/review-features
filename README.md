# OWASP Review: Indicators Per Project Category
The following table provides an overview of the indicators that determine when an Code/Tool OWASP project belongs to a certain maturity level. This table is a basic guideline for the reviewer to establish how to classify an OWASP project. It is not 'black/white' checklist. The reviewer should use his/her judgement to analyze the specific situation of each project. The most important indicators to keep in mind are:
* User feedback: Because determines user adoption and based on the feedback, reviewer can actually establish code maturity level by looking at (positive/negative) feedback
* Industry recognition: A project that has community recognition , such as, appearing in important news outlets, being selected as speaker or trainier, in important security conferences, shows that the project has reached also some quality and uniqueness level due to the level of requirements to be accepted (see for example speaker requirements: https://www.blackhat.com/us-15/call-for-papers.html) or the kind of information quite relevant to the subject, important enough to called the attention of the press
* Active leadership: A project leader involved in the development and promotion of a project shows a level of commitment to it. This is quite important to establish the potential continuity and of a project.
* Vendor neutrality: OWASP does not endorse any product, services or tools. The following disclaimer/About OWASP text can be used in projects or press releases that reference external products, services or tools. We ask that the community look out for inappropriate uses of the OWASP brand including use of our name, logos, project names and other trademark issues. 

These above indicators provide a signal of maturity level regarding user adoption of a project, which aligns to OWASP mission and should, at all times, be the highest and important indicators to establish its level. The reviewer is not required to test the project , such as to confirm the if the project builds correctly, however, having some experience as developer/software programmer is advisable in order to look for clear signals of quality and understand the development of the project. 

* 'X' simbolize  a required requirement for that category.

* '-' Symbolizes that requirement is not needed for that category
