#Importance of a well thought out Road-map for Incubator projects

Many Incubator project leaders struggle with creating a realistic planning, which should be based on their available resources and time. A well thought out plan makes a difference between a procrastinating project and a successful one. The important aspect of this is, that the project leader is able to create a plan based on his situation. The following is an example of a Roadmap, which has focused to produce a Documentation first release in a year and a basic outline how they plan to cover 4 essential aspects which are Research & Development, Marketing, Planning and Goals.

"Your [project] roadmap should tell a coherent story about the likely growth of your product. Each release should build on the previous one and move you closer towards your vision. Your roadmap should be convincing and realistic: Donâ€™t speculate or oversell your [project]. Be clear who your audience is: An internal roadmap talks to development, marketing, sales, service, and the other groups involved in making your [project] a success; and external one talks to existing and prospective customers." Extracted from : "[10 Tips for Creating an Agile Product Roadmap]"
Start defining a development, documentation and marketing plan for your project. Set short , medium and long term plans. Include promotion of your project, this is very important in order to engage users and consumers of your project. Contact project coordinator and the Project Task Force to help you achieve this goal. You can run a single person project, but it's usually best to get the community involved. You should be prepared to support a mailing list, build a team, speak at conferences, and promote your project.
You can contribute existing documents or tools to OWASP! Assuming you have the intellectual property rights to a work, you can open it to the world as an OWASP Project. Please coordinate this with OWASP by contacting owasp(at)owasp.org.

#Roadmap in case of older projects (classified as incubators/LAB)
Some projects have been in the incubator stage for quite long period of time, however, they have developed a quite stable code source and project features. In this case, they project migh have less need for a more detailed roadmap. It is important that the reviewer can analyze specific situations, especially when a project has a quite stable release and no need to continue develop new features.
