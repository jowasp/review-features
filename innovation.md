#Innovative approach/ project

It means that the project has something completly different, unique and original that differentiates it from other projects. 
Wheter in the problem that it tries to solve or the solution offered.

Innovation can be viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs.[2] This is accomplished through more effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are readily available to markets, governments and society. The term innovation can be defined as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that "breaks into" the market or society.[3]

Example: If there is a project that already does the same (for example OWASP has many 'vulnerable applications') then there is definetly a lack of originality.
