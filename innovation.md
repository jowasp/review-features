#Innovative approach - project

It means that the project has something completly different, unique and original that differentiates it from other [open source] projects.  Wheter in the problem that it tries to solve or the solution offered creating a high value to its users.

Innovation can be viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs.[2] This is accomplished through more effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are readily available to markets, governments and society. The term innovation can be defined as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that "breaks into" the market or society.[3]

Example: If there is a project that already does the same (for example OWASP has many 'vulnerable applications') then there is definetly a lack of originality. A project offering the same solution as another existant projects, has not a touch of innovation, however if it offers a solution that no other (open source) projects offers, a 'unique value proposition' such as 
* Implementimng a new way if doing things
* Implementing a new technology
* Unique selling proposition value to the security community

"Also known as a unique selling proposition (USP), your UVP is a clear statement that describes the benefit of your offer, how you solve your customerâ€™s needs and what distinguishes you from the competition. Your unique value proposition should appear prominently on your landing page and in every marketing campaign."

Then it can be considered to have an innovative approach. 

Example: 
* ZAP proxy implements ZEST scripts (no other proxy offers this option) to help testers develop automated pen testing 
* ZAP was the first to implement Web Sockets (before any commercial proxy had it)
* ZAP has add-ons development to facilitate collaboration
